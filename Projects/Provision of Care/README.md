Provision of Unpaid Care
================

This project analyses the proportion of people providing unpaid care in
2021 according to the England and Wales census. The below shows how the
rate of provision has changed over the last decade. Since the need for
care is highly dependent on the age profile of the population, both raw
rates and age-standardised rates are shown in the table. The
standardised rate adjusts the raw rates in 2021 using direct
age-standardisation and with the 2011 population as the baseline age
structure.
