Provision of Unpaid Care
================

This project looks at who is providing unpaid care in 2021 according to the England and Wales census. The aim is to look at whether the provision of unpaid care has increased or decreased since the last census in 2011, and how the socio-demographic profile of unpaid carers has changed over that period.

### Changes in the Provision of Unpaid Care Rates

The below shows how the proportion of people providing care has changed over the last decade. Since the need for
care is highly dependent on the age profile of the population, both raw rates and age-standardised rates are shown in the table. Direct age-standardisation is used to adjust the raw rates for 2021 based on the age structure of the 2011 population.
