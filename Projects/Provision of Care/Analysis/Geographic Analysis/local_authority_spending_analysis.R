# DESCRIPTION: This file calculates rates of provision of unpaid care by Local Authority in 2021 and then looks at whether the change in rates since 2011 is associated with the change in social care
# spending in each Local Authority.

# - Areas with larger increases in mortality rates in 2018 (compared to 2011) did not see a significantly different change
# - Areas with higher levels of spending in 2011 saw less of an increase. Same if using 2018 variable.
# - When looking at the change in spending between 2011 and 2018, the absolute change is non-significant, but the relative change shows that areas with increased spending saw bigger increases.
# - Once controlling for mortality rates, deprivation is not significant
