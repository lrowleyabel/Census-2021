This project analyses the proportion of people providing unpaid care in 2021 according to the England and Wales census. The below shows how the rate of provision has changed over the last decade. Since the need for care is highly dependent on the age profile of the population, both raw rates and age-standardised rates are shown in the table. The standardised rate adjusts the raw rates in 2021 using direct age-standardisation and with the 2011 population as the baseline age structure.
